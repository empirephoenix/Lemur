/**
 *  Keeps track of a set of "collision roots" for mouse picking
 *  and performs the pick event processing necessary to deliver
 *  MouseEvents and CollisionEvents to spatials with either the
 *  MouseEventControl or CursorEventControl attached.  (The
 *  actual event delivery is done by the PickEventSession class
 *  for which this app state has one active session.)
 *
 *  <h2>PickEventSession behavior:</h2>
 *
 *  <p>Collision roots may either be perspective or orthogonal
 *  and the appropriate type of collision is done.  The ViewPort's
 *  camera is used to detect the difference.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Events are delivered in near to far order to any 'target'
 *  that the cursor ray collides with until the event is consumed.
 *  Enter and exit events are delivered as targets are acquired or
 *  lost.</p>
 *
 *  <p>If a button down event happens over a target then it is considered
 *  'captured'.  This spatial will be provided to subsequent events
 *  in addition to the normal target.  Furthermore, any new motion
 *  events are always delivered to the captured spatial first.<p>
